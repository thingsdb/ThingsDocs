Socket connections can listen to events from ThingsDB.

This chapter explains how and when ThingsDB sends events to socket connections. You only need to read this if you want to implement the event handling yourself. If possible, you should use a *native client/connector* and read the corresponding documentation on how to handle ThingsDB events as a *client/connector* most likely has *out-of-the-box* support for event handling.

{{% notice note %}}
There is no option to listing to event when using the HTTP API.
{{% /notice %}}

The following events may be received by a client:

Event | Description
------------ | -----------
[NODE_STATUS](./node-status) (`0`) | The connected node has changed its status.
[WARNING](./warning) (`5`) | A warning message from ThingsDB.
[ON_JOIN](./on-join) (`6`) | Emitted when a room is joined.
[ON_LEAVE](./on-leave) (`7`) | Emitted when leaving a room *(only when explicitly leaving a room, not on a client disconnect)*.
[ON_EMIT](./on-emit) (`8`) | a *change* is emitted to this room.
[ON_DELETE](./on-delete) (`9`) | A joined [room](../data-types/room) is removed from ThingsDB.

> The number `0-9` represents the package type in a [package header](../connect/socket/#package).

## Node status changes and warnings

When connected and authenticated with a socket connection, you will automatically receive *[node-status-changes](./node-status)* and *[warning-events](./warning)*.

## Join rooms

When joining one or more rooms, ThingsDB is guaranteed to return with the response on the join request before the *[on_join](./on-join)* event(s) are being transmitted.
The *[on_leave](./on-leave)* event is only transmitted when an explicit request is made to leave a room. Thus, this event is *not* triggered when a client disconnect, or when a node is shutting down.
