This is the `string` type of ThingsDB. A value of type `str` *should* contain valid UTF-8 characters. This
is not guaranteed but rather depends on [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) to pack data correctly.
There is an [is_utf8](../../collection-api/is/is_utf8) function which can be used to test a `str` value for valid UTF-8
data and it is also possible to create an `utf8` property on a custom [Type](../../overview/type) which only allows strings
with valid UTF-8 data.
