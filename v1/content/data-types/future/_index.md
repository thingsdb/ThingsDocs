Futures are mainly used for modules, but they can also be used to run some code at some later time.
A future does not require a *change*. If the future is followed with a `then` or `else` closure, then the
code inside this closure will generate it's own event if required.

For example, the code below will always create a *change*, no matter what the value of `x` is. This is because ThingsDB
has to know if a *change* is required before it knows the value of `x`.

```thingsdb,syntax_only
if (x > 10) {
    .answers.push(x);
};
```

When using a future we could optimize the code:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
if (x > 10) {
    future(nil, x).then(|_, x| {
        .answers.push(x);  // This will still require a *change*, but the event
                           // is only created when x > 10.
    });
};
```

Instead of using the `future(nil, ..).then(|_, ..| ..)` construction, a future accepts a closure as first argument to be used as a shortcut. So the above can be written as:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
if (x > 10) {
    future(|x| {
        .answers.push(x);  // This will still require a *change*, but the event
                           // is only created when x > 10.
    });
};
```

Arguments _may_ be provided by a list. In this case the length of the list must match the number of arguments accepted by the closure:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
future(|x| {
    .answers.push(x);  // x = 10
}, [10]);
```

Arguments _must_ not contain stored data with an Id. Such an argument must be provided using the Id as ThingsDB otherwise has no way of knowing that the object with Id still exists in the context when using the object.

```thingsdb,syntax_only
.x = {};

future(|x| {
    .answers.push(x);
}, [.x]);  // !!ERROR: context does not allow arguments which are stored by Id
```

Parse such a thing by using the plain Id:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
future(|x_id| {
    x = thing(x_id);
    .answers.push(x);
}, [.x.id()]);  // Parse the plain Id
```

### Modules

When a future is used to call a [module](../../modules), the first argument of the future will be the request for the module and must be a thing containing at least a `module` property.

For example, the code below will trigger the [module](../../modules) `DEMO`. The module would receive `{module: "DEMO"}` as request.

```thingsdb,syntax_only
future({
    module: 'DEMO'
});
```

Besides the required `module` property, a property `deep` will be understood and will tell ThingsDB how [deep](../../collection-api/deep) the request must be packed. The default *deep* value is the current *deep* value.

For example:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
// We can be explicit with deep and then must use at least 2, otherwise the items are not packed for the module request
future({
    module: 'DEMO',
    deep: 2,
    items: [{
        name: 'item1'
    }, {
        name: 'item2'
    }]
});
```

Data from a module is returned to ThingsDB as [mpdata](../../data-types/mpdata) by default. For example:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
// Suppose we have a DEMO module which accepts a message and returns with a reply message:
future({
    module: 'DEMO',
    message: 'This is a test'
}).then(|reply| type(reply));  // type reply will be `mpdata`, not `str` !!
```

The above is fine if we want the result, in this case the `reply`, back to our client. If we on the other hand want to do
something with the `reply` message, we can either choose to call [.load()](../../data-types/mpdata/load) on the `reply` value but
a better option would be to set the `load` property to `true` in the request, for example:

```thingsdb,syntax_only
// Suppose we have a DEMO module which accepts a message and returns with a reply message:
future({
    module: 'DEMO',
    load: true,
    message: 'This is a test'
}).then(|reply| type(reply));  // now `reply` is of type `str`
```
