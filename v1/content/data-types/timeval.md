Type `timeval` is exactly the same as type [datetime](../datetime). The only difference is the
default return. The return value of a `timeval` type is the value as a UNIX time stamp, while
type `datetime` returns with the time as a string in ISO8601 format.

Why type `timeval`? It is possible to return a `datetime` as `int(datetime)` to get the UNIX time stamp, so why use `timeval`?
It is often easier to work with time stamps then with time as string values.

```thingsdb,json_response
tv = timeval(2020, 12, 10);   /* type timeval, 10 December 2020 */
dt = datetime(2020, 12, 10);  /* type datetime, 10 December 2020 */
assert (tv == dt);            /* true, both have the same time */
assert (type(tv) == 'timeval');
assert (type(dt) == 'datetime');
{
    dt: dt,
    tv: tv
};  // Return value is different
```

> Return value in JSON format

```json
{
    "dt": "2020-12-10T00:00:00Z",
    "tv": 1607558400
}
```
