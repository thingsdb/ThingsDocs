The *deep* value determines how many levels of data are returned by a query. Only *things* count towards this value. See [deep()](../../collection-api/deep) for more info about the *deep* value.

The default *deep* value for the *@node* and *@thingsdb* scopes has been set to `1`. Collections will inherit the *deep* value from the *@thingsdb* scope so they also have `1` as their default unless the *@thingsdb* scope is changed.

This function can be used to change the *deep* value for a scope.

{{% notice warning %}}
**Be careful** with changing the *deep* value as this will effect queries where *deep* has not explicitly been specified. In ThingDB version 1.2.x the default value was set to `127`.
{{% /notice %}}

Use `deep();` to view the current *deep* value in a scope.

This function generates a [change](../../overview/changes).

### Function
