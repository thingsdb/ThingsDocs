Might be used for debugging code. The message will be logged as a warning message on the console of the node which is processing the request.
When you are connected using a socket stream, then a [warning message](../../listening/warning) with code `2` will be send to the client as well.

This function does *not* generate a [change](../../overview/changes).

### Function

### Arguments

Argument | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------

### Return value

### Example

> Returns the reference count of a given value:

```thingsdb,json_response
log("Test.., one, two, three");
```

> Example return value in JSON format
